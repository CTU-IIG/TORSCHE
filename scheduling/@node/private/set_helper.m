function object = set_helper(object, property, value)
%SET_HELPER Internal function for property setting.
%
%    SET_HELPER(OBJECT, PROPERTY, VALUE) sets PROPERTY of an OBJECT to
%    the VALUE.
%    
%    This function has to be copied to every descendant of SCHEDOBJ
%    class. Matlab's OOP behavior is very limited and this function
%    allows us to overcome some of these limations.
